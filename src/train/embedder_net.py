# This class is the feature extraction network used in the Siamese model to produce image embeddings.
# It uses ConvNeXt, a modern and productive convolutional backbone well-suited for visual similarity tasks.
# The first two stages of ConvNeXt are frozen to preserve low-level features and reduce training time and overfitting.
# The extracted features are projected to produce compact embeddings of a fixed dimension.
